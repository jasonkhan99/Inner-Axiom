1.  1 playable battle screen. The environment is made from a 10 x 10 grid of tiles with textures. Sprites representing the characters take up one tile on the grid and move along the tiles (a la chess or checkers). The player interacts with the game using a menu with options such as move, attack, wait etc. A win occurs if all enemy sprites are defeated. A loss occurs if the main character is defeated.
