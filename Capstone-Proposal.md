Inner Axiom

A tile based Sci-fi RPG in which the main character comes into contact with an alien life form and recieves the ability to experience other parallel universes. The design of the game is centered on the main characters newly acquired ability.

MVP

1.  1 playable battle screen. The environment is made from a 10 x 10 grid of tiles with textures. Sprites representing the characters take up one tile on the grid and move along the tiles (a la chess or checkers). The player interacts with the game using a menu with options such as move, attack, wait etc. A win occurs if all enemy sprites are defeated. A loss occurs if the main character is defeated.

2.  The properties of game objects will become randomized upon a loss. Instead of the typical death screen, our main character will "switch" realities when facing defeat. When the "game" reloads a sprite may have different equipment or stats or name etc. It's as if the main character is trying to find an alternate universe in which they survive the encounter.
