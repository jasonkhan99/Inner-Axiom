## __Description__
<br/>

This is a Sci-fi story. Our Hero comes into contact with an alien entity and receives the ability to experience parallel universes. The design of the game is centered around this concept. This story actually started as a screenplay I wrote way back in my film school days. I’ve always been curious about game design and development and I grew up with video games. I never got the chance to film that script but am excited about reincarnating it as a game.

I am someone who believes strongly in a design aesthetic where not only is a story told through words and images, but through the properties of the medium itself. Inner Axiom uses core programming concepts to tell it’s story. When you lose in an RPG you “die” and you can retry from the last save point. Instead of dying and retrying, we reshuffle. When our Hero loses, they decide to “move” to a parallel universe. One that is different, one in which they might have survived. However, this universe may have unexpected qualities, large or small. Perhaps you have a different weapon or armor, perhaps you are fighting inside rather than outside. Or perhaps, your significant other is just a friend. Inner Axiom attempts to employ code that will shuffle items, stats, characters, conversations, settings and even outcomes and relationships as a result of loss. But remember, technically our Hero is not “moving” into another universe, they are simply perceiving all universes simultaneously… A truth that may factor into the story towards the climax.

## __MVP__
<br/>

1.  1 playable battle screen. The environment is made from a 10 x 10 grid of tiles with textures. Sprites representing the characters take up one tile on the grid and move along the tiles (a la chess or checkers). The player interacts with the game using a menu with options such as move, attack, wait etc. A win occurs if all enemy sprites are defeated. A loss occurs if the main character is defeated.

2.  The properties of game objects will become randomized upon a loss. Instead of the typical death screen, our main character will "switch" realities when facing defeat. When the "game" reloads a sprite may have different equipment or stats or name etc. It's as if the main character is trying to find an alternate universe in which they survive the encounter.

3.  A win or lose screen. This screen will appear after a battle and allow you to continue if you won and grant experience, items and money not unlike many typical RPGs. It will allow you to retry (which will reshuffle the game objects) or exit the game if you lost.

## __Stretch Goals__
<br/>

1.  A title screen that will be the starting point and the place players return to when they select exit game.

2. A story screen that is built just like the battle screen except that it is not player controlled, everything is scripted and there is dialog that advances the story.

3. Additional game screens.

This project is ongoing and not all of these goals have been met.

## __Known Bugs__
<br/>

- The hit success indicator arrow is inverted and the foreground does not fill the background as it should.

- There is a visual bug that occasionally occurs, it looks as if small pieces of the stat panel linger on the screen when they should not.
